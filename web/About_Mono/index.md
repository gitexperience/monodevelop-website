Mono, the open source development platform based on the .NET framework,
allows developers to build Linux and cross-platform applications with
improved developer productivity. Mono's .NET implementation is based on
the ECMA standards for
[C\#](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-334.htm)
and the [Common Language
Infrastructure](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm).

Sponsored by Novell, the Mono project has an active and enthusiastic
contributing community. Mono includes both developer tools and the
infrastructure needed to run .NET client and server applications. It is
positioned to become the leading choice for development of Linux
applications.
